Methodology
The methodology for this project follows a structured approach to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize data related to Taylor Swift's songs and their chart performance. The steps are outlined below:

1. Data Collection
The data used in this project was sourced from the following: Billboard Hot 100 Dataset: A CSV file containing weekly data on the performance of songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, including song titles, artists, and ranking data over the past decade.
Spotify Dataset: Spotify's API was used to extract audio features for each song, including attributes like danceability, energy, acoustics, and liveness.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
To ensure the data is accurate and suitable for analysis, the following steps were taken: Missing Values: Any rows with missing data for key features (e.g., song name, artist name, chart position) were either removed or filled with reasonable defaults (if applicable).
Duplicate Removal: Duplicate records were identified and removed to prevent skewing the analysis.
Data Type Conversion: Data types were verified, and columns like date were converted to the appropriate datetime format for easy manipulation.
Data Merging: Data from the Billboard Hot 100 and Spotify were merged based on song title and artist to create a complete dataset with chart performance and audio features.

3. Feature Engineering
New features were created to gain more insights from the existing data: Song Longevity: Calculated the number of weeks each song spent on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
Peak Position: Extracted the highest chart position achieved by each song on the Billboard Hot 100.
Genre Classification: Added categorical labels for the genre of each song based on common industry knowledge (e.g., Pop, Country, Rock).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to uncover patterns and insights from the data: Trend Analysis: Plotted time series data to observe trends in Taylor Swift’s songs' chart performance over time.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed the correlation between various audio features (e.g., danceability, acoustics, energy) and chart position using Pearson’s correlation.
Top Hits: Identified which songs had the longest duration on the charts and the highest peak positions.

5. Data Visualization
Various data visualizations were created to help understand and communicate the findings: Line Graphs: Used to show the weekly progression of songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
Bar Charts: Created to compare the peak positions of Taylor Swift's songs across albums.
Heatmaps: Visualized correlations between different audio features (e.g., danceability vs. energy, acoustics vs. popularity).
Word Cloud: A word cloud was generated to highlight the most common terms in Taylor Swift's song titles.

6. Modeling (Future Work)
The next steps in the analysis will involve building predictive models to: Predict Chart Success: Using machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) to predict the likelihood of a song's success on the charts based on its audio features.
Genre Classification: Building a model to classify songs into genres based on audio features, leveraging supervised learning algorithms.

7. Limitations
Some limitations of this project include:
Incomplete Dataset: The dataset does not include data for Taylor Swift's live performances or international chart data.
Song Metadata: Not all songs have consistent metadata across both the Billboard Hot 100 and Spotify, leading to some data inconsistencies.
